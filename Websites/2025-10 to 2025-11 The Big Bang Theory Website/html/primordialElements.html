        <h1>Primordial Elements</h1><br/>
        <p>
          Primordial nucleosynthesis was the process that created the lightest elements. As the universe expanded and cooled down, protons and neutrons fused together in order to form deuterium (hydrogen isotope). Which then further fused in order to form helium-3 and tritium (also hydrogen isotope), leading to those two elements to fuse together and form helium-4.
        </p><br/>
        <p>
          A trace amount of lithium-7 and beryllium-7 were also formed. The primordial elements are the three elements that were formed during this process, hydrogen, helium and lithium - they are also known as the lightest chemical elements.

          All of the above Daniel wrote, and I'm just the scribe. I'm also fairly sure we're trying to do the same thing to achieve fusion energy (it's based on the same technology?) But no promises.

          Here's a helpful diagram that I don't understand either:

          TL:DR Primordial elements include Hydrogen, Helium, trace amounts of Lithium and Beryllium.
