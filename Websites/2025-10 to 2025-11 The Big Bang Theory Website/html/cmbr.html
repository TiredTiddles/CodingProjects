        <h1>Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation</h1><br/>
          <p>
            This is something that is very cool. It provides evidence that the big bang happened.
          </p><br/>
          <h2>What was CMBR?</h2>
            <p>
              According to the big bang theory at the beginning the universe was both extremely dense and hot, which didn't allow photons to travel freely, as other electrons scattered them.
            </p><br/>
            <p>
              Recombination occurred when the universe was 380,000 years old, and light could finally travel freely. It is this light that we call CMBR.
            </p><br/>
            <p>
              The unvierse isn't so hot anymore because it's been 13.8 billion years, and the universe has become much bigger, and hence cooler since then
            </p><br/>

              This is an image I stole from wikipedia. Hopefully it's high quality. It depicts a temperature map of CMBR from theq Planck Spacecraft.
            </p><br/>
          <h2>What did it help us discover?</h2>
            <p>
              This helped us discover a variety of things:<br/><br/>
              <ul>
                <li>The age of the universe</li>
                <li>A more accurate Hubble constant</li>
                <li>Proportions of dark matter, dark energy, and normal matter</li>
                <li>The geometry of the universe (it's almost flat)</li>
              </ul><br/>
              This means that it was pretty important.
