        <p>
          Redshift is when light waves get stretched so that they move towards the red side of the light spectrum. This occurs when a light source moves away from an observer and is a result of the Doppler effect. The reason why this happens in space is because the universe is constantly expanding which means that as the universe expands and stretches the light waves also stretch. Furthermore as according to Hubble’s Law the further away an object or celestial body is from Earth the faster it moves away from us. We can determine how far away a celestial body is from Earth.

        <p>
          Blueshift is when light waves get stretched in the opposite direction that cause them to get redshifted so that the light waves move to the blue side of the light spectrum. This occurs when a light source moves towards an observer. Observations show that almost every single galaxy is redshifted with only very few being blueshifted.
